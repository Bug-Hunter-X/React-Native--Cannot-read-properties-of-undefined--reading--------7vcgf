This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common error in React Native, especially when dealing with asynchronous data fetching.  For example, if you're rendering a component before the data has loaded, and you try to access a property of that data (e.g., `this.state.data.name`), you'll get this error if `this.state.data` is still null or undefined.  Another common cause is improperly handled navigation parameters or props that are not yet defined when the component mounts.
